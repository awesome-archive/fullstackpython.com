meta: Python example projects and code that show how to use the SQLAlchemy object-relational mapper (ORM).


[SQLAlchemy](/sqlalchemy.html) is a Python library for interacting
with [databases](/databases.html) either through SQL or with an
[object-relational mapper (ORM)](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html).

This page describes projects that use SQLAlchemy to accomplish some
goal, such as data analysis, running a web application's back end,
or providing a [web API](/application-programming-interfaces.html).

[sandman2](https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman2)
([project documentation](https://sandman2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and
[PyPI package information](https://pypi.org/project/sandman2/))
is a code library for automatically generating 
[RESTful APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html) from
existing database schemas. This approach is handy for solving 
straightforward situations where you want to put an abstraction
layer between one or more applications and your 
[relational database](/databases.html) to prevent or reduce
direct database access.
