meta: Learn how to create Flask applications with easy to copy and paste Python code examples for the Flask web framework.


[Flask](/flask.html) is a Python [web framework](/web-frameworks.html).

## Flask Example Projects
Flask's large ecosystem of extensions make it easier for developers to
build common web app features such as authentication, 
[database](/databases.html) operations and 
[APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html) even though support
is not built into the core Flask [web framework](/web-frameworks.html).
This design is by choice in contrast to [Django](/django.html)'s 
"batteries-included" approach. Either framework's design decision 
is a viable approach depending on the needs and requirements of the
application you are building.

The extensive collection of Flask libraries is a great source for
learning the framework through reading code examples.

This alphabetically-ordered list of projects provide helpful example
code for building your own web apps.


### flask-base
[flask-base](https://github.com/hack4impact/flask-base) 
([project documentation](http://hack4impact.github.io/flask-base/))
is a boilerplate starter application that is pre-configured with 
[SQLAlchemy](/sqlalchemy.html), [Redis](/redis.html), user 
authentication and other features.

flask-base's code is open sourced 
[under the MIT license](https://github.com/hack4impact/flask-base/blob/master/LICENSE.md).


### FlaskBB
[FlaskBB](https://github.com/flaskbb/flaskbb)
([project website](https://flaskbb.org/)) is a [Flask](/flask.html)-based

### Flasky
[Flasky](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) is the wonderful 
example application by 
[Miguel Grinberg](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg) that he builds
while teaching developers how to use [Flask](/flask.html) in 
[his books and videos](https://courses.miguelgrinberg.com/). Flasky
is [open sourced under the MIT license](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky/blob/master/LICENSE).

Code examples from Flasky are shown on the following pages:
