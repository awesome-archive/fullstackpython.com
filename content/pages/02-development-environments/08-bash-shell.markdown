meta: The Bourne-Again Shell (Bash) is an implementation of the shell concept and is often used during Python software development.


The [Bourne-Again SHell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 
([source code](https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash)), almost 
always referred to simply as "*Bash*", interprets and executes input 
entered from a source such as the user or a program. Bash is an 
implementation of the [shell concept](/shells.html) and is often used 
during Python software development as part of a programmer's 
[development environment](/development-environments.html).
