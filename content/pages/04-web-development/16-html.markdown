### HTML resources
* Mozilla's 
  [HTML page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  and
  [introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)
  break down HTML by elements, metadata and forms before diving
  into more advanced web development topics.

* [A few HTML tips](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/a-few-html-tips/)
  is written for beginners who are learning HTML. The article gives guidance
  on common mistakes to avoid and what to do instead to write proper HTML.

* CodeAcademy's 
  [HTML basics](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-HZA3b/0/1)
  course provides an interactive environment for learning the
  gist of the markup language.

* [A list of everything that *could* go in the head of your document](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD)
  provides a comprehensive reference for elements that are required
  or optional in the `<head>` element of your webpage.

* [(Why) Some HTML is "optional"](https://remysharp.com/2019/09/12/why-some-html-is-optional)
  gives historical context for the `<p>` paragraph element as an example
  to explain how HTML was originally designed. The backwards-compatibility
  remains because there is not enough optimization juice to squeeze from
  changing the implementation compared to the backwards-breaking changes
  in rendering existing sites.
